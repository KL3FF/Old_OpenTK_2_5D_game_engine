# Old OpenTK 2.5D Game Engine

This is one of my older projects, where I tried to create a **Hollow-Knight-like 2.5D representation**. The project is not fully finished, and I haven't worked on it further.

## About the Project

- **Built with:** C# and OpenTK  
- **Framework:** OpenTK is a wrapper for OpenGL, making it easier to use OpenGL in C#.  
- Originally developed as an experimental project, it can also serve as a template for other projects.

Everyone is welcome to use it if they like.  
**Have fun!**
